* Clojure Solopreneours Meetup
** Meetup 1: Hello, World!
The first Clojure Solopreneours meetup had 8 participants and lasted
for around 3 hours!

We started with an introduction round where everyone introduced
themselves and what they're working on.

I'm writing these notes after the fact, so my memory of each
presentation is so so. Feel free to PR a summary of your intro down
below :^). If you're not familiar with org syntax, just write as plain
text and I (Olav) will fix any markup issues.

  I talked about my SaaS https://anymentions.ai, which is a tool to
  connect startups with the people who's problems they're trying to
  solve. Concretely, it notifies users whenever a post matching a
  given problem description is posted on Reddit.

  AnyMentions originated as an internal tool I built for a previous
  startup saas, we where working on the problem of landlord/tenant
  conflicts, and therefore wanted to reach out to everyone on Reddit
  talking about this. I thought to myself "it wouldn't be too hard to
  build a little Clojure thing to ping us whenever someone posts about
  this" and I had it working within the week.

  Turning it into a proper product is another story entirely ðŸ˜…
